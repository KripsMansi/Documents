# Integrating Facebook and WooCommerce

This guide outlines the step-by-step process of integrating Facebook and WooCommerce for seamless management of your online store and social media presence.

## Setting Up Facebook Integration

1. **Create a Facebook App**:
   - Go to the [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) portal.
   - Click on "My Apps" and then "Create App".
   - Choose the appropriate app type (e.g., Business).
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the app creation process.

2. **Retrieve App ID and App Secret**:
   - Once your app is created, navigate to its dashboard.
   - You'll find your App ID and App Secret there. Keep these credentials secure as they are required for accessing Facebook's APIs.

3. **Set Up Facebook Page**:
   - If you haven't already, create a Facebook Page for your business or organization.
   - Ensure that you have admin access to this page as you'll need it for posting content programmatically.

4. **Generate User Access Token**:
   - Obtain a User Access Token with the necessary permissions for managing your Facebook page.
   - You can generate this token manually through Facebook's Graph API Explorer or via a server-side process.

## Integrating WooCommerce

1. **Install WooCommerce**:
   - If you haven't already, install and set up WooCommerce on your WordPress website.
   - WooCommerce is a plugin that adds e-commerce functionality to your WordPress site.

2. **Set Up WooCommerce REST API**:
   - Enable the WooCommerce REST API by navigating to WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > REST API.
   - Generate API keys by going to WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > REST API > Keys/Apps and clicking on "Add Key".
   - Create a key by specifying a description, user, and permissions (Read/Write) and generate the keys.

3. **Retrieve WooCommerce Store URL**:
   - Note down the base URL of your WooCommerce store. It usually follows the format `https://yourdomain.com`.

4. **Test WooCommerce API**:
   - Before integrating with other systems, ensure that your WooCommerce API is working correctly.
   - You can test it using tools like Postman or cURL by making sample requests to your store's API endpoints.

## Integrating Facebook and WooCommerce

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Use Composer to install the necessary PHP libraries for integrating with Facebook and WooCommerce.
   - Run `composer require facebook/graph-sdk automattic/woocommerce` in your project directory.

2. **Configure the Script**:
   - Copy the provided PHP script into your project directory.
   - Update the script with your Facebook App credentials (App ID, App Secret), Facebook page ID, User Access Token, and WooCommerce API credentials (Store URL, Consumer Key, Consumer Secret).

3. **Execute the Script**:
   - Run the PHP script from the command line using `php your_script_name.php`.
   - Ensure that the script executes without errors and successfully fetches products from WooCommerce and posts them on Facebook.

4. **Test and Debug**:
   - Test the integration thoroughly in a development environment.
   - Monitor for any errors or issues during product fetching or posting.
   - Debug as necessary and make adjustments to the script for optimal performance.

5. **Schedule and Automate**:
   - Once the integration is working as expected, consider scheduling the script to run at regular intervals using cron jobs or task schedulers.
   - This allows you to automate the process of updating your Facebook page with new products from your WooCommerce store.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate Facebook and WooCommerce to streamline your e-commerce operations and enhance your online presence.
